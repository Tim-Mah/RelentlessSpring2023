This was made for our 2nd year Game Development class, made in about 4 months with Unity.

Our game is a 2D story platformer about a character’s tough journey battling with anxiety. The player will explore a series of levels which use heavy symbolism to depict the main character’s healing process and demonstrate coping mechanisms through the use of mini-games. Our goal is to shed light on the non-linear healing process of overcoming mental health issues and to provide players with a story that they can hopefully relate to and learn from.
