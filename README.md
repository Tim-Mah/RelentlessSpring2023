This was made for our 2nd year Game Development class, made in about 4 months with Unity.

Our game is a 2D story platformer about a character’s tough journey battling with anxiety. The player will explore a series of levels which use heavy symbolism to depict the main character’s healing process and demonstrate coping mechanisms through the use of mini-games. Our goal is to shed light on the non-linear healing process of overcoming mental health issues and to provide players with a story that they can hopefully relate to and learn from. 

# **Controls**
[space] to skip text/dialogue
A or [left arrow] to move backwards, D or [right arrow] to move forwards
[space], [up arrow], or W to jump
Use [shift] to dash (move in a horizontal straight line for a short time)
Wall Slide by holding direction keys (arrows or A, D) in direction of wall
Wall Jump by pressing a jump key while wall sliding

# **My Contributions**
I coded the movement system, implimenting *coyote time, double jump, wall jumps + grab, dash*, as well as all the platforms and materials (floating, moving, ice, jump platforms, 2 way and 1 way platforms). I also coded the camera movement script for levels 1, 3, 4. I also arranged the art for each level (some hand drawn, some premade assets) and designed + animated the main character. I designed and tested the 3rd level.

# **Level Design Goals**

_Level 1_ is focused on the core mechanics (run, jump, wall jump, dash)
- Fast paced, dynamic platforming

_Level 2_, dash is disabled. The player can only use dash through red areas (which they can only stay in a few seconds)
- Methodical, timing

_level 3_, wind pushes the player backwards
- Slower, strategic platforming

_level 4_, after the player falls into the water, they start to freeze. Stand beside the campfires to warm up.
- Rushed, against the clock

*Lvl 4 is unfinished and is lacking assets.*


# **Reflection**

If we had the chance to do this project again, we would make the scope of the project much smaller. Designing and play-testing four different levels was very time consuming, which didn’t give us enough time to perfect the other elements of the game (health, tutorial, story, animation). Premade 2d assets would have made this easier. The 2.5D style of the game meant layering different assets free-hand, which was exponentially more time consuming than using a flat art style.
